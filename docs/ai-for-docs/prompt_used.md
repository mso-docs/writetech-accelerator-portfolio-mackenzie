# Prompt Used

I used ChatGPT to create a prompt for the project.
This prompt was based on the Step-by-Step instructions from our Assignment Google Doc.

Here is the prompt I entered:

```powershell
I am documenting Ollama and Llama 4 for my technical writing assignment. I need to use the Llama documentation/model cards to create an outline of the Llama 4 model. Use the following text from my assignment as parameters:
Use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to generate:
An outline or summary or FAQs from the model page
You must document your prompt and output
```

This is the prompt it returned:

```powershell
Using the official Llama 4 docs/model cards (Scout & Maverick) and the Ollama library page, produce a concise outline covering: (1) purpose & intended use, (2) architecture (MoE, multimodality) and context windows, (3) supported languages, (4) benchmark highlights (MMLU‑Pro, MMMU, GPQA‑Diamond, MGSM, LiveCodeBench), (5) licensing/acceptable‑use notes, (6) key risks/limitations & recommended mitigations (Prompt Guard/Llama Guard), and (7) how to run llama4:scout with Ollama on Windows. Keep it to bullet points, 200–300 words. Cite sources inline for me to build a bibliography."
```

I used this prompt to immediately prompt ChatGPT in a new chat. You can see the response on the [AI Output](ai_output.md) page.
