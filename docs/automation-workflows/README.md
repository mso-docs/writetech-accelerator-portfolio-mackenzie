# Automation & Workflows

## Overview  
This project focuses on automating code quality processes using linting and validation workflows integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.

## Deliverable  
- Automated linting configuration (e.g., ESLint, stylelint)  
- Validation scripts to check code quality and formatting  
- Integration with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or other workflow automation tools  

## Features  
- Pre-commit or pre-push hooks triggering linting  
- Automated runs on pull requests or commits  
- Reporting and fail-fast feedback mechanisms  

## How to Use  
- Run lint manually: `npm run lint` (or equivalent)  
- Configure CI workflows located in `.github/workflows` or similar  
- Customize rules in configuration files (`.eslintrc`, etc.)  

## Resources  
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
