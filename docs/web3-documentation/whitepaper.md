# Luminia Verse: The Interoperable Metaverse Protocol

> **Overview:** Luminia Verse** is an open interoperability protocol that enables seamless asset and identity portability across Web3 gaming and metaverse platforms. Built on Ethereum and Layer 2 solutions, it provides the infrastructure for a truly connected multiverse where digital assets retain value and utility across virtual worlds.

### Key Features

- **Universal Avatar Standard (LVA-721)** - Portable identity NFTs with cross-world compatibility
- **Asset Bridge Contracts** - Secure smart contracts for transferring assets between chains
- **Developer SDK** - Simple integration tools for Unity, Unreal, and Godot engines
- **Cross-World Economy** - Unified marketplace for interoperable digital assets

### Benefits

- **For Players**: Maintain persistent identity and inventory across all compatible games
- **For Developers**: Reduce integration costs with ready-made wallet and NFT infrastructure  
- **For Creators**: Monetize assets across multiple platforms with automated royalty distribution

### Technical Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum mainnet with zk-rollup Layer 2 scaling
- **APIs**: GraphQL and REST endpoints for efficient asset querying
- **SDKs**: JavaScript libraries and game engine integrations
- **Token**: LUMI (ERC-20) for governance, fees, and ecosystem incentives

## 1. Problem Statement

The Web3 gaming and metaverse landscape is **fragmented**. Each game, world, and marketplace runs its own token standards, avatar systems, and asset registries. Players invest in digital identity, skins, or land in one environment—only to find those assets **locked and non-portable** elsewhere.  
Developers face high integration costs, while users lose value and continuity of identity.

---

## 2. Proposed Solution

**Luminia Verse** introduces an **open interoperability layer** that allows avatars, NFTs, and in-game items to move seamlessly between virtual worlds.  
Built atop the **Ethereum mainnet and Layer 2 sidechains**, Luminia Verse uses a shared registry and standardized asset-metadata contracts to define ownership, provenance, and compatibility across participating metaverses.

Key objectives:

- **Universal Avatar Standard (LVA-721):** Portable identity NFTs with customizable traits and on-chain metadata.
- **Asset Bridge Contracts:** Secure, audited smart contracts for transferring NFTs or in-game tokens between chains.
- **Open Developer SDK:** Simple APIs for game engines (Unity, Unreal, Godot) to integrate asset verification and wallet login.
- **Cross-World Economy Hub:** Aggregated marketplace and liquidity routing for interoperable assets.

## 3. Technology Architecture

| Layer | Components | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Core Smart Contracts** | `LVARegistry`, `AssetBridge`, `WorldAdapter` | Registry maps user avatars and assets to verified world addresses. Bridges handle mint/burn or lock/unlock events across chains. |
| **Middleware (APIs)** | GraphQL & REST endpoints for off-chain querying | Game devs fetch avatar attributes, textures, and history without heavy RPC calls. |
| **Front-End Integrations** | SDKs + JS libraries | Simplify wallet auth (MetaMask, WalletConnect), asset rendering, and transaction UX. |
| **Consensus & Security** | Ethereum mainnet + zk-rollup Layer 2 | Mainnet anchors identity state; rollups batch micro-transactions to keep fees low. |

**Workflow Example**

1. Player logs in via wallet → avatar NFT is verified through `LVARegistry`.
2. World A reads attributes (skin ID, accessories).
3. Player teleports to World B → `AssetBridge` locks the NFT on Layer 2 and mints a mirror token in World B.
4. When the player returns, the bridge burns the mirror and unlocks the original.

## 4. Token Model (LUMI)

| Parameter | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **Symbol** | LUMI |
| **Type** | ERC-20 utility & governance token |
| **Supply** | 1 billion (fixed, deflationary through burns on bridge fees) |
| **Use Cases** | Staking for validator roles, paying cross-world transaction fees, DAO voting, creator royalty routing |
| **Distribution** | 40 % ecosystem grants, 25 % community airdrop, 20 % dev fund, 10 % foundation, 5 % advisors |

**Economic Incentives**

- Validators earn LUMI for securing bridge events.
- Developers stake LUMI to register new worlds or assets.
- Players receive small LUMI rebates when transferring verified assets.

---

## 5. Target Audience & Use Cases

**For Players:**  

- Carry one avatar identity across all compatible games.  
- Retain inventory and achievements independent of publishers.  

**For Developers:**  

- Reduce onboarding friction via ready-made wallet + NFT infrastructure.  
- Tap into an interoperable economy without reinventing token standards.

**For Brands & Creators:**

- Mint limited edition cross-world wearables, cosmetics, and digital collectibles.  
- Earn royalties each time items move or resell across ecosystems.

## 6. Roadmap (Year 1 – Year 3)

| Phase | Milestones |
|--------|-------------|
| **Q1 – Q2 2026** | Launch testnet registry & bridge; SDK alpha for Unity. |
| **Q3 2026** | Mainnet bridge deployment; LUMI token TGE. |
| **2027** | DAO governance activation; integration with 3 major metaverse partners. |
| **2028** | Cross-chain rollup support (zk-EVM bridge) and mobile SDK. |

---

## 7. Vision & Impact

Luminia Verse envisions a **persistent, user-owned metaverse** where digital identity and assets transcend the confines of single worlds.  
By standardizing interoperability at the protocol level, it aims to transform isolated virtual economies into a **shared multiverse**—open, composable, and creator-driven.
