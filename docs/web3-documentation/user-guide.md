## What is MetaMask?

**MetaMask** is a non‑custodial crypto wallet and gateway to Web3. It stores your **wallet keys locally** in your browser extension or mobile app, lets you **send/receive tokens**, **swap assets**, and **connect to decentralized apps (dApps)**. You control your **secret recovery phrase (SRP)**; MetaMask (and dApps) cannot recover it for you.

---

## Prerequisites

Here is what you will need to get started using MetaMask:

- A supported browser: **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Brave**, or **Edge**; or the **MetaMask mobile** app (iOS/Android).
- A secure device with up‑to‑date OS and browser.
- Optional: a **hardware wallet** (Ledger/Trezor) for added key security.

---

## Install MetaMask

The sections below will show you how to install MetaMask:

### Desktop (Browser Extension)

Follow the steps below if you are installing MetaMask on Desktop:

1. Visit the **official MetaMask site** and choose your browser’s extension store.
2. Install **MetaMask** and pin it to your toolbar.
3. Open the extension — you’ll see **Create a new wallet** or **Import an existing wallet**.

> **Note:** Always verify you’re installing the official extension. Avoid links from social media or ads.

### Mobile (iOS/Android)

Follow the steps below if you are installing MetaMask on a mobile device:

1. Open the **App Store** or **Google Play** and search for **MetaMask**.
2. Install the app and open it.
3. Choose **Create** or **Import**.

---

## Create or Import a Wallet
The sections below will show you how to create or import a wallet using MetaMask:

### Create a New Wallet

Follow the steps below to create a new wallet:

1. Set a **strong password** (protects local access to MetaMask on your device).
2. Securely back up your **Secret Recovery Phrase (12/24 words)**:
   - Write it down **offline**; store in two separate secure locations.
   - Never share it; no site or staff will ever ask for it.
   - Do **not** screenshot or store it in cloud notes.
3. Confirm the SRP by selecting words in order.

### Import an Existing Wallet

Follow the steps below to import an existing wallet:

1. Choose **Import** and enter your **Secret Recovery Phrase**.
2. Set a new local **password** on this device.
3. (Optional) Import via **JSON/Private key** for single accounts — note: SRP is preferred since it can regenerate multiple accounts.

> **Tip:** You can create multiple accounts (Account 1, Account 2, …) under the same SRP. Each has a unique address.

---

## Fund Your Wallet (Mainnet & Testnets)

Follow the steps below to fund your Mainnet or testnet wallet(s):

### Mainnet

Follow the steps below if you are using a mainnet wallet:

- **From an exchange:** Withdraw **ETH** (or tokens) to your MetaMask **0x… address**.
- **Fiat on‑ramp:** Some regions can buy ETH directly inside MetaMask (fees vary).

### Testnets (Sepolia example)

Follow the steps below if you are using a testnet wallet: 

- Use a **faucet** to request test ETH for development and learning. Search “**Sepolia faucet**”, sign in (if required), and paste your **0x… address**.
- Switch MetaMask to **Sepolia** first so you can see the test ETH when it arrives.

> **NOTE:** Transfers can take seconds to minutes depending on network conditions.

---

## Add/Select Networks

MetaMask ships with **Ethereum mainnet** by default. 

The steps below illustrate how to work with testnets or other EVM networks:

1. Click your **network dropdown** (top of MetaMask).
2. Select a network (e.g., **Sepolia**) or **Add a network**.
3. For custom networks, you’ll enter:
   - **Network name** (e.g., “Sepolia”)
   - **RPC URL** (HTTPS endpoint)
   - **Chain ID** (e.g., 11155111 for Sepolia)
   - **Currency symbol** (e.g., ETH)
   - **Block explorer URL** (optional)

> **NOTE:** If a dApp supports **Add network** via EIP‑3085, MetaMask will prompt you with the correct details automatically.

---

## View & Add Tokens

By default, MetaMask shows **ETH**.

To see other tokens, follow the steps below:

- **Auto detection:** Toggle **Auto‑detect tokens** in Settings (varies by network).
- **Manual add:** Click **Import tokens**, paste the token’s **contract address** (then symbol/decimals auto‑fill), and confirm.

> **Note:** Get the contract address from the project’s official site or a trusted block explorer page. Avoid copy‑pasting from random posts.

---

## Send & Receive Crypto
You can send and receive cryptocurrency using MetaMask. The sections below will guide you through the process of sending and receiving.

### Receive

Follow the steps below to receive cryptocurrency using MetaMask:

1. Click your **account name** to copy your **0x… address**.
2. Share this address with the sender (or your exchange withdrawal form).

### Send

Follow the steps below to send cryptocurrency using MetaMask:

1. Click **Send**.
2. Paste the recipient’s **0x… address** (double‑check the first/last 4 characters).
3. Select **Asset** (ETH or an ERC‑20 token) and **amount**.
4. Choose a **gas option** (MetaMask suggests a fee; you can edit).
5. Review details and **Confirm**.

> ⚠️**Warning:** Transactions are **irreversible**. If you send to the wrong address or wrong network, funds may be lost.

---

## Swap Tokens in MetaMask

To swap tokens using MetaMask, follow the steps below:

1. Click **Swap** in MetaMask.
2. Select **From** (e.g., ETH) and **To** (e.g., USDC).
3. MetaMask aggregates quotes; choose the best route/price.
4. Review **slippage**, **network fee**, and **route**, then **Confirm**.
5. Wait for confirmation; the swapped token appears under your assets (add it if not auto‑detected).

>**Note:** For large trades, consider slippage tolerance and route transparency (DEX aggregators vs. single DEX).

---

## Connect to a dApp

You can also connect to a dApp using MetaMask. The steps below will show you how this works:

1. Open a dApp (e.g., a DEX, NFT marketplace, game).
2. Click **Connect Wallet** → **MetaMask**.
3. MetaMask shows a **connection prompt** listing **accounts** and the **permissions** requested (e.g., view address, suggest transactions).
4. **Approve** connection (or **Reject**). You can disconnect later.

### Switching accounts & networks

You can switch accounts and networks in the dApp. When doing so, keep the following in mind:

- Your **active account** is the one the dApp sees; switch it via MetaMask’s account menu.
- If the dApp requires a different network, MetaMask can **switch networks** on prompt; confirm to proceed.

---

## Manage Approvals & Permissions

The following sections will show you how to manage approvals and permissions in MetaMask.

### Token Approvals (ERC‑20 / NFT)

Token approvals using the dApp in MetaMask has the following approval/permission process:

- Interacting with some dApps requires an **approval** that lets a smart contract spend your tokens/NFTs.
- When prompted, review the **spender contract** and **allowance** (unlimited vs. custom amount).
- To **revoke** or **reduce** allowances later, use:
  - MetaMask’s **Connected sites** / **Permissions** panels, and/or
  - A reputable **token approval manager** dApp (search “revoke token approvals”) and follow on‑chain revoke steps.

### Site Connections

In MetaMask **Settings → Security & Privacy → Connected sites**, review and **disconnect** any dApps you no longer use.

> **Note:** Limiting approvals reduces risk if a dApp or contract is compromised.

---

## Gas Fees (EIP‑1559) & Settings

Ethereum uses **EIP‑1559** fee fields for gas fees.

This indicates the following:

- **Max base fee** (protocol‑determined, dynamic)
- **Max priority fee** (aka “tip” to miners/validators)
- **Max fee** (ceiling you’re willing to pay)

In MetaMask:

- Choose **Low / Market / Aggressive** presets or **Advanced** to set custom **max fee** and **priority fee**.
- For urgent txs (e.g., NFT mint), use a higher **priority fee**; for routine transfers, default presets are fine.

## Speed Up / Cancel

The following apply to speeding up or cancelling a transaction:

- If a tx is pending, you can **Speed Up** (send a replacement with higher fee).
- You can also **Cancel** (send a 0‑value replacement to yourself with higher fee).
- Success isn’t guaranteed but often works if the original hasn’t been mined.

---

## Troubleshooting

The following information may be useful for troubleshooting within MetaMask:

- **“Insufficient funds for gas”**: Reduce amount, increase funds, or switch to a cheaper time; ensure you have **ETH** for gas (even when sending tokens).
- **Token not showing**: Add the **token contract** via **Import tokens**.
- **Wrong network**: Switch the network to where funds exist; assets are network‑specific.
- **Stuck transaction**: Try **Speed Up** with higher fee; if needed, **Cancel** (same nonce, higher fee). Wait for block confirmation.
- **Phishing warning / scam site**: Disconnect immediately and **revoke approvals** for suspicious contracts. Never sign messages you don’t understand.
- **Ledger/Trezor connection issues**: Update firmware, enable **contract data**, and re‑connect via MetaMask’s **Connect hardware wallet** flow.

---

## Security Best Practices

Follow the best practices below to keep your MetaMask account secure:

- **Protect your Secret Recovery Phrase** (offline, never share).
- Prefer **hardware wallets** for large balances.
- Lock MetaMask when not in use (click **Lock**).
- Verify **URLs**; bookmark official sites. Beware of **airdrop** or **support** scams.
- Review and **limit approvals**; revoke unused allowances.
- Keep OS, browser, and MetaMask **updated**.
- Use **distinct wallets** for day‑to‑day vs. high‑value assets.
- Consider **watch‑only** wallets for monitoring without keys.

---

## Glossary

You can check the glossary below to learn more about the terms you encountered in this guide:

- **Account / Address**: Your public identifier starting with **0x…**; derived from your private key.
- **Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP)**: 12/24 words that can regenerate your keys. Loss = loss of funds.
- **Gas / Fees**: Payment to validators to include your transaction in a block.
- **EIP‑1559**: Fee market mechanism with base fee + priority tip, improving fee predictability.
- **Allowance / Approval**: Permission for a contract to spend your tokens.
- **Non‑custodial**: You control your keys; no third party can restore your wallet.
- **Testnet**: Practice network with valueless tokens (e.g., **Sepolia**).
