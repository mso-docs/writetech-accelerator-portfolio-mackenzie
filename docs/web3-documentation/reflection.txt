WriteTech Accelerator — Web3 Documentation Final Project  
Reflection by Mackenzie O’Brien  
October 2025

This final project gave me a holistic understanding of the communication layers within Web3 documentation.  
By completing all three options (A–C), I experienced how different audiences shape tone, structure, and technical depth.

Option A (Alchemy Node API) challenged me to think like a developer.  
I learned how to present complex JSON-RPC calls with clarity, reproducible examples, and minimal ambiguity.  
Breaking down authentication, endpoints, and error handling in a walkthrough format taught me how small details—such as formatting consistency and real command-line samples—build developer trust.

Option B (MetaMask User Guide) reminded me of the importance of accessibility and empathy in technical writing.  
I focused on guiding new users through onboarding, security, and decentralized concepts without jargon.  
This exercise reinforced my ability to write documentation that bridges the gap between complex blockchain systems and non-technical audiences.

Option C (Luminia Verse White Paper) allowed me to shift from instructional to visionary writing.  
It was an opportunity to define a protocol’s mission, technology, and tokenomics at a strategic level.  
I learned how to balance technical precision with narrative flow—translating an abstract idea into a credible, structured proposal for investors and developers alike.

Together, these three deliverables demonstrate full-spectrum documentation capability:
- Technical API reference (developer documentation)
- User onboarding and support (end-user documentation)
- Conceptual and strategic communication (white paper / product vision)

This project solidified my understanding that great documentation is not just about explaining technology—it’s about connecting people to technology in ways that inspire confidence, usability, and innovation.
