## 🧩 Option A — API Documentation Rebuild  
**Project:** Alchemy Node API  
**Audience:** Developers integrating with Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoints  
**Deliverable:** [`api.md`](./api.md)

### Summary
This deliverable improves the clarity and usability of the **Alchemy Node API** documentation by expanding on three core JSON-RPC methods:

| Method | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `eth_getBalance` | Retrieves an account’s balance (in Wei) at a specific block |
| `eth_getBlockByNumber` | Returns detailed information for a block by number |
| `eth_sendRawTransaction` | Broadcasts signed transactions to the Ethereum network |

### Features
- Step-by-step **walkthrough format** for developers new to JSON-RPC  
- Real **curl, JavaScript, and Python** code samples  
- Authentication setup for **mainnet** and **testnets** (Sepolia, Holesky)  
- Troubleshooting for common JSON-RPC errors  
- Best practices for **secure key management** and **fee optimization**
