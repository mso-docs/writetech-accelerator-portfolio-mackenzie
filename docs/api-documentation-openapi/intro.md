# API Documentation Project Overview

This project documents the **Pok√©API v2** public REST API, with a focus on the **Berry-related endpoints**.  

The documentation includes a **Getting Started guide**, structured **endpoint references**, and an **OpenAPI specification** for developer tooling.

## What I Improved
- Converted raw notes into clear, structured **Markdown files** for each endpoint (`berry.md`, `berry-firmness.md`, `berry-flavor.md`).
- Created **schema tables** for fields, types, and examples, improving readability and usability for developers.
- Added a **generated OpenAPI spec** (`pokeapi-berries.yaml`) to support tools like Swagger UI or ReDoc.

## Challenges
- Normalizing a large, unstructured block of endpoint details into reusable documentation sections.
- Deciding how to represent nested array/object fields in Markdown tables while keeping examples concise.

## What I Learned
- How to apply **documentation best practices** (splitting endpoints into dedicated files, using schema tables, adding examples).
- How to integrate API reference content with an **OpenAPI specification** to make the docs more developer-friendly.
